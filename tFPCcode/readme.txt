Implementation of "Temporal-dependent Principal Component Analysis of Two-dimensional Functional Data"

The code for implementation of Temporal-dependent Functional Principal Component Analysis (tFPC) method.

There are three folders.

1. "functions" folder: includes the necessary R/Cpp functions for tFPC method, and the compared mFPC method.

2. "Simulations" folder: includes the code for reproducing the results of simulation studies in the article.

3. "Texastemp" folder: includes the data and code for reproducing the results of Texas temperature analysis.
